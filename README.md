# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. The app allows users to add and remove tasks from their to-do list.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server with the following command:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

The To-Do List app consists of a simple interface that allows users to manage their tasks. Here's how you can use it:

1. Start by entering a task in the input field labeled "Add ToDo...". 

2. Press Enter or click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

3. The newly added task will appear at the bottom of the list.

4. To mark a task as completed, click on the task's text. The task will be visually marked as completed.

5. To remove a task from the list, click on the task's text while holding the "Ctrl" (Windows) or "Command" (Mac) key.

6. Repeat the steps above to add, complete, or remove more tasks from the list.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into multiple files to keep it modular and maintainable:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It includes the necessary script tags to load React and other dependencies.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the To-Do List app. It is linked to the HTML file to apply the defined styles.

- `form.js`: This file contains the code for the `TodoForm` component, which is responsible for rendering the input field and handling form submission. It exports the component to be used in other files.

- `todo.js`: This file contains the code for the `Todo` component, which represents an individual task in the list. It handles the removal of a task when clicked and exports the component to be used in other files.

- `index.js`: This file is the entry point for the React application. It imports the necessary components (`App`, `TodoForm`, and `Todo`) and renders the `App` component into the HTML element with the id "root".

## Customization

You can customize the To-Do List app by modifying the code and styles to suit your needs. Here are a few suggestions:

- Adjust the styles in the `styles.css` file to change the appearance of the app.

- Add new features or functionality by extending the existing components or creating new ones.

- Store the to-do list data in a backend server or a database for persistence.

- Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own separate to-do lists.

## Dependencies

The To-Do List app relies on the following dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html): A package that provides DOM-specific methods for React components.

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): A JavaScript compiler that enables the use of modern JavaScript features and JSX syntax.

Please refer to their respective documentation for more information on how to use these libraries.
